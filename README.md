Use the'left' and 'right' arrows on your keyboard to highlight the character you would like to play as. 
Press 'enter' to make your selection and begin the game. Once you are in the game, use the 'up', 'down', 
'left', 'right' arrows to control your character. You can run off the left or right side of the screen 
in order to get to the opposite side of the game board. You cannot go off the top or bottom edges however.
Cross the field to get to the river and find the key. Return to the top of the screen to unlock the box

Good luck!
